# Class-Oriented-Programming
A couple examples of using Class Oriented Programming

This repository is created to demonstrate my class oriented programming in Python. This respository will include a damage calculator for a nightblade bomber in eso, a replication of NumPy features, and multiple statistical calculators that I used for my class at UNC.

1. Damage Calculator:
    Using this to compare and contrast different setups my friend was able to go number one on our 30 day campaign back to back. Long may he reign.
2.Replicating NumPy features as Simpy (Simpy simps for NumPy is my professor's joke...):
    This was an excerise through class but it demostrates the basics of class oriented programming such as overloading operators, methods, and constructors.
3. Statistical Calculators: 
    This was my first class oriented programming. Right when I learned it, I began to think where I could I apply this. It was evident this would be a good fit in my statistical       homework. Samples have various attributes associated with it and make a sample class seemed like the best way to automate my homework and practice writing class objects.
